# Cornestone Landing Page

Cornestone Landing Page Theme represents the Kajabi UX Team's opinionated starting point for new theme projects. It strives to include up-to-date best practices and solutions that we have deemed needed for the majority of themes we build. It is a reflection of whatâ€™s possible when building a theme!

## Intentional lack of styles

When launching Cornestone for the first time, you may notice a lack of CSS styles. Is Cornestone broken? Definitely not! Keep in mind this was done intentionally. Cornestone is not a framework but rather a starting point for your project. It contains all the files the Shopify Themes team considers to be the bare essentials to building a Shopify theme.

For templates and snippets, standard Liquid tags and logic have been included with little to no markup, classes, or other code that you will need to remove. The src/styles/theme.scss file contains extremely limited styling to not get in the way of developers' CSS preferences.

## Getting started

Cornerstone works great along with your text editor and git to create a local version controlled enviornment terrifif for development. The link below will help you get setup.
